# This program is a simple song list that allows a user to track songs that they wish to learn and songs they have completed learning. The program reads and writes a list of songs in a file.
# Each song has:
# â€¢	title, artist, year, whether it is required (y) or learned (n)
# Users can choose to see the list of songs, which should be sorted by artist then by title.
# Users can add new songs and mark songs as learned.
# They cannot change songs from learned to required.
